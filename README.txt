To run the app, you are going to have to create a virtual environment and download all the necessary requirement from the requirement.txt

I followed the steps at bottom of https://github.com/fmipython/PythonCourse2022/blob/main/13%20-%20Modules/13%20-%20Modules.ipynb
For setting up the VENV.

You can the run the main.py file with F5 or run the pytest tests in the tests folder

Check the main.py file for more info on how the app works! 

*The docs in the Moodle zip are not finished because I ran out of time. You can read the full docs from the GitHub repo, 
or alternatively download the project from the repo itself.
